## 1.IMAGE FILES:
        All image files are stored in the 'images' folder. 
        All these images have already been cropped to contain only the lip region with the process described 
            in our paper. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06990.pdf)
        
## 2. AUDIO FILES
        Audio files are stored in the "audio" folder.
        Each audio is cropped with the actual word in the cecnter and extra 200ms temporal expansion 
            before and after the word respectively to faciliate some further data augmentation operations.
        
## 3. TEXT FILES
        Textual Annotation files are stored in the 'info' folder, with the name 'trn' for train, 'tst' for test and
            'val' for validation. 
        Data in different difficulty levels divided by different attributes are listed in the three folders named 
            "Pose", "Resolution", and "Length" with files including the keyword "easy", "medium" and "hard".   
        Each column in the txt files is as follows:
            Image_Folder_Name, 
            Audio_Folder_Name (optional),
            Class_Name in the format of Chinese_characters, 
            Class_Name in the format of Chinese_PinYin (composed by English alphabet), 
            Start_Time of the word (#seconds),
            End_Time of the word (#seconds). 
        Note: All the videos in the dataset are 25 fps and so the start/end frame-index of each word is corresponding 
        to the product result of start/end time and 25.
